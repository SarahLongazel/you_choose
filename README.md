# Console You-Choose Story
This program is written in Python and runs in the console. 

It displays my knowledge with lists, loops, functions, and sequencing.

## Features
1. Two lists that contain used information in the program.
2. A master Loop that the user interacts with and can exit.
3. Atleast three functions defined and called with one returning a value later used in the code.
